    "text": "Geo-PEACE\n\n\n\nBackground\nSingaporeans often take their homeland’s low crime rate for granted, carrying this perception when traveling abroad. Malaysia, a popular destination due to its proximity and affordability, offers many conveniences. However, assuming the same level of safety as in Singapore can lead to unwise decisions.\nThis project seeks to enhance awareness of crime and safety issues in Malaysia, helping tourists better assess travel risks. We are employing techniques such as Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Spatial Weights Analysis (SWA) and various Clustering Analyses, to identify trends crime hotspots and cold spots. This project aims to offer travelers more informed guidance when selecting destinations within Malaysia.\n\n\n\nProject Objectives\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualisation: Develop highly-readable maps and plots to explore spatial trends related to crime and its sub-types within the study area\nClustering: Implement hierarchical clustering, ClustGeo and SKATER clustering analyses to investigate spatial distribution of crime in Malaysia\nInteractivity: Enable dynamic selection of parameters (year, region, clustering settings, etc.) and other user-friendly feature using Shiny\n\n\n\n\nDatasets\n\nCrime Rates working data: Aspatial Data that covers specifics of the crimes committed in the various states.\nShapefile (Administrative level 0-2): Shapefile that contains the district boundaries of Malaysia\n\n\n\n\nLiterature Review\n\nCriminological Insights: A Comprehensive Spatial Analysis of Crime Hot Spots of Property Offenses in Malaysia’s Urban Centers\n\nObjective:\n\nTo examine patterns in property crimes in Selangor, Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya from 2015-2020\nTo understand the evolution and dynamics of property crimes\nTo better understand the effects of the National Transformation Programme\n\nGeospatial and Aspatial Data:\n\nStudy areas (Geospatial data) were methodically chosen for their wealth, geopolitical landscape and vibrant city life and attractions. More specifically, the study makes use of the Police Station boundaries in these states.\nProperty Crime incidents and their spatial characteristics served as the aspatial data for the study.\n\nMethods Deployed:\n\nGlobal Measure of Spatial Autocorrelation: Global Moran I’s Statistic\nLocal Measure of Spatial Autocorrelation & Hot spot analysis: Getis-Ord Gi* Statistic\n\nLearnings and Takeaways:\n\nInstead of deploying a wide range of different measures, the study deployed these two methods using different categories (By year, By Location) to gain a more comprehensive understanding of crimes of the this nature\nUsing Police/Jurisdical boundaries to examine crime events is very appropriate and will be useful when chaneling efforts to lower crime rates\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApproach and Methodology\nThe approach centers on the district-level analysis of both regions of Malaysia, East and West (Peninsular) Malaysia. The project begins with data wrangling to resolve discrepancies between the datasets, followed by EDA to understand the big picture of crime distribution in Peninsular and East Malaysia. Additionall, deriving crime rate figures rather than using crime absolute crime figures provided in the crime dataset helps\nKey details include:\n\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n\nBarchart, Box-plots, Histograms\nPlotting choropleth maps to reflect the spatial distribution of crimes in Malaysia\n\nCrime rate calculation\n\nCrime rate \\(R_{i,t,c}\\) for district \\(i\\) year \\(t\\), and crime type \\(c\\) is then computed as the proportion of crimes of type \\(c\\) in district \\(i\\) relative to the total crimes in the same district and year, expressed as a percentage:\n\nThus, each crime rate figure corresponds to the proportion of a specific crime type relative to the total crimes reported in that district for the given year.\nIn practice, the crime rate for each district and year is calculated using the following R code:\n\n\nCode\ncrime_merged &lt;- crime_merged %&gt;%\n  mutate(year = as.integer(format(as.Date(date.y), \"%Y\")), .before= 11)\n\n# Calculate crime rate\ncrime_merged &lt;- crime_merged %&gt;%\n  group_by(ADM1_EN, ADM2_EN, year) %&gt;%                 # Group by district and year\n  mutate(total_crimes_year = sum(crimes),     # Calculate total crimes per district per year\n         crime_rate = (crimes / total_crimes_year) * 100, .before= 13) %&gt;%  # Calculate crime rate for each row\n  ungroup() %&gt;%\n  select(-total_crimes_year) %&gt;% \n  select (-c(2,4,5,8))\n\n\n\nGlobal and Local Spatial Autocorrelation (SWA)\n\nGlobal: Make use of measures such as Moran I’s to determine if the spatial patterns of the crime events are clustered, randomly distributed, or show a pattern of dispersion.\nLocal: Make use of measures such as Local Moran I’s and Getis-Ord Gi* statistic to identify cold and/or hotspot areas for crime events in our study area.\n\nClustering Analysis\n\nDeploy Hierarchical Clustering, SKATER Approach and ClustGeo to observe for any natural clustering of spatial units based on the crime rates.\n\nMapping our results and Interpretation\nConclusion\n\n\n\n\nApplication System Architecture\n\n\n\n\nR packages Used:\n\nshiny: For building the interactive web application.\nggplot2: For creating bar charts, histograms, and boxplots.\ndplyr: For data manipulation and filtering.\nsf: For handling spatial data.\ntmap: For map visualization.\nspdep: For spatial dependence analysis and creating neighbors lists.\nheatmaply: A package that helps to plot heatmaps.\n\n\n\n\nStoryboard\n\nInitial Idea\n\n\n\nFinal Prototype\nSections:\n\nData tab\n\nEDA tab\n\n\nESDA tab - 3 subtabs:\n\nChoropleth\n\nGlobal\n\nLocal\n\n\nClustering\n\nHCLUST\n\nDendrogram\n\nHeatmap\n\nMap\n\n\nCLUSTGEO\n\nMap\n\n\nSKATER"

Hence, we decided to check for the unique districts in each of the dataframe.\n\nunique(pop_data$district)\n\n\nunique(adm2_sf$ADM2_EN)\n\n\nunique(crime_district$district)\n\nAs expected, all the dataframes contained different numbers of districts. There were also lots of discrepancies to be handled; differing spelling/naming conventions, splitting of districts into north/south regions, and totally missing districts.\nAs little can be done in salvaging missing districts, we decided to handle the other forms of discrepancies.\nFirst, we will convert all the district names to lowercase letters to eliminate any errors on that front, and to standardise the naming conventions.\n\ncrime_district$district &lt;- tolower(trimws(crime_district$district))\nadm2_sf$ADM2_EN &lt;- tolower(trimws(adm2_sf$ADM2_EN))\npop_data$district &lt;- tolower(trimws(pop_data$district))\n\nSince our main focus was crime data and it was the dataframe that will be mutually connected to both the boundary layer and the population data (phrase better), we will use the districts in the crime dataframe as a guide to formatting the other tables.\nWe first started off by handling the very obvious differences that could be observed through visual inspection as well as through the use of the unique function. We noticed that 2 districts, Johor Bahru and Klang, were split up in the crime dataframe. Hence, we merged these rows and summed up their crime number values.\nstr_detect() function of the stringr package was used to identify rows that contained the given input string. In our case, it was the district name. mutate() was then used to change the values of these rows. Since this produces a new dataframe, another dataframe was created with the rest of the values, before all three were bound together.\n\nlibrary(stringr)\ncrime_johor&lt;- crime_district %&gt;%\n  filter(str_detect(district,\"johor bahru\")) %&gt;%\n  mutate(district = 'johor bahru') %&gt;%\n  group_by(state, district,type, date) %&gt;%\n  summarise(crimes = sum(crimes))\n\ncrime_klang&lt;- crime_district %&gt;%\n  filter(str_detect(district,\"klang\")) %&gt;%\n  mutate(district = 'klang') %&gt;%\n  group_by(state, district,type, date) %&gt;%\n  summarise(crimes = sum(crimes))\n\n\nother_rows &lt;- crime_district %&gt;% \n  filter(!str_detect(district, \"johor bahru\"))\n\ncrime_district &lt;- bind_rows(crime_johor, crime_klang, other_rows) %&gt;% \n  select(-c(6)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(category = 'assault')\n\nNext, we sought to isolate the districts in the other dataframes that were still not matching with that of the crimes dataframe. To do this, a left join of the tables were performed, before the NA rows were extracted and saved in a separate dataframe.\n\npop_crime&lt;- left_join(pop_data, crime_district, by= \"district\")\npop_crime_na&lt;- pop_crime[rowSums(is.na(pop_crime)) &gt; 0,]\n\n\nadm_crime &lt;- left_join(adm2_sf, crime_district, by= c(\"ADM2_EN\" = \"district\"))\nadm_crime_na &lt;- adm_crime[rowSums(is.na(adm_crime)) &gt; 0,]\n\nThis made it easier for identifying dissimilarities, although it was still tedious. After much close comparisons, we managed to identify a handful of spelling and formatting errors across the three dataframes. Hence, we made changes to these rows.\n\ncrime_district&lt;- crime_district%&gt;% \n  mutate(district = ifelse(district == \"cameron highland\", \"cameron highlands\", district)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(district = ifelse(district == \"kuala lipis\", \"lipis\", district)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(district = ifelse(district == \"kota kinabatangan\", \"kinabatangan\", district)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(district = ifelse(district == \"seberang perai tengah\", \"s.p. tengah\", district)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(district = ifelse(district == \"seberang perai utara\", \"s.p. utara\", district)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(district = ifelse(district == \"seberang perai selatan\", \"s.p.selatan\", district)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(district = ifelse(district == \"petaling jaya\", \"petaling\", district)) %&gt;% \n   mutate(district = ifelse(district == \"matu daro\", \"matu\", district))\n  \n\npop_data &lt;- pop_data %&gt;% \n  mutate(district = ifelse(district == \"kulai\", \"kulaijaya\", district)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(district = ifelse(district == \"sp tengah\", \"s.p. tengah\", district)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(district = ifelse(district == \"sp utara\", \"s.p. utara\", district)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(district = ifelse(district == \"sp selatan\", \"s.p.selatan\", district)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(district = ifelse(district == \"cameron highland\", \"cameron highlands\", district))\n\nOnce this was done, we isolated the NA values once again. The remaining districts are districts that were missing from one or more of the dataframes, and would have to be removed from the analysis due to the missing data.\n\npop_crime&lt;- left_join(pop_data, crime_district, by= \"district\")\npop_crime_na&lt;- pop_crime[rowSums(is.na(pop_crime)) &gt; 0,]\n\ndrop_list_pop &lt;- pop_crime_na$district\npop_data &lt;- pop_data %&gt;%\n  filter(!(district %in% drop_list_pop))\n\npop_crime2&lt;-left_join(crime_district, pop_data, by=\"district\")\npop_crime_na2 &lt;-pop_crime2[rowSums(is.na(pop_crime2)) &gt; 0,]\n\ndrop_list_pop &lt;- pop_crime_na2$district\ncrime_district &lt;- crime_district %&gt;%\n  filter(!(district %in% drop_list_pop))\n\n\nadm_crime &lt;- left_join(adm2_sf, crime_district, by= c(\"ADM2_EN\" = \"district\"))\nadm_crime_na &lt;- adm_crime[rowSums(is.na(adm_crime)) &gt; 0,]\n\ndrop_list &lt;- adm_crime_na$ADM2_EN\nadm2_sf &lt;- adm2_sf %&gt;% \n  filter(!(ADM2_EN %in% drop_list))\n\nadm_crime2 &lt;- left_join(crime_district, adm2_sf, by= c(\"district\" = \"ADM2_EN\"))\nadm_crime_na2 &lt;- adm_crime2[rowSums(is.na(adm_crime2)) &gt; 0,]\n\ndrop_list &lt;- adm_crime_na2$ADM2_EN\ncrime_district &lt;- crime_district %&gt;% \n  filter(!(district %in% drop_list))\n\nNow, we would be able to join the dataframes smoothly.\n\nwrite_rds(pop_data, \"data/rds/pop_data.rds\")\nwrite_rds(crime_district, \"data/rds/crime_district.rds\")\nwrite_rds(adm2_sf, \"data/rds/adm2_sf.rds\")\n\n\npop_data&lt;- read_rds(\"data/rds/pop_data.rds\")\ncrime_district &lt;- read_rds(\"data/rds/crime_district.rds\")\nadm2_sf &lt;- read_rds(\"data/rds/adm2_sf.rds\")"
