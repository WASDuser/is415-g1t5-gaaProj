One of the most popular getaway destinations for us is our neighbour, Malaysia, given the multiple factors of convenience like proximity and the relatively lower cost. However, it will not be wise to assume the same level of safety as we have in Singapore.\nOur project aims to raise awareness about the crimes and safety issues in Malaysia, so that tourists can manage travel risk for their destinations. Spatial Point Pattern Analysis can aid in providing useful insights on the distribution of crime in Malaysia. Exploratory Data Analysis can be utilised to identify hotspots or cold spot areas for crimes of different types, providing travellers with more concrete information when deciding which states to travel to.\n\n\n\nProject Objectives\n\nVisualise the Crime events on a map of the study area\nFigure out if there are any patterns relating the crime type and the spatial units in the study area\nIdentify the crime rates hotspots and clusters\n\n\n\n\nDatasets\n\nCrime Rates working data: Aspatial Data that covers specifics of the crimes committed in the various states.\nShapefile (Administrative level 0-2): Shapefile that contains the admin boundaries of Malaysia\n\n\n\n\nLiterature Review\n\nCriminological Insights: A Comprehensive Spatial Analysis of Crime Hot Spots of Property Offenses in Malaysia’s Urban Centers\n\nObjective:\n\nTo examine patterns in property crimes in Selangor, Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya from 2015-2020\nTo understand the evolution and dynamics of property crimes\nTo better understand the effects of the National Transformation Programme\n\nGeospatial and Aspatial Data:\n\nStudy areas (Geospatial data) were methodically chosen for their wealth, geopolitical landscape and vibrant city life and attractions. More specifically, the study makes use of the Police Station boundaries in these states.\nProperty Crime incidents and their spatial characteristics served as the aspatial data for the study.\n\nMethods Deployed:\n\nGlobal Measure of Spatial Autocorrelation: Global Moran I’s Statistic\nLocal Measure of Spatial Autocorrelation & Hot spot analysis: Getis-Ord Gi* Statistic\n\nLearnings and Takeaways:\n\nInstead of deploying a wide range of different measures, the study deployed these two methods using different categories (By year, By Location) to gain a more comprehensive understanding of crimes of the this nature\nUsing Police/Jurisdical boundaries to examine crime events is very appropriate and will be useful when chaneling efforts to lower crime rates\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApproach and Methodology\n\nData Preparation\n\nSourcing data and Importing data\nData Wrangling\n\nProcessing imported data to keep only needed information\nRestricting study area\nHandling missing/duplicated data\nCleaning up of data\nExamine data to identify patterns\nJoining of boundary and working data\nPerform a write and read to rds for easier access to variable\n\n\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n\nVisualising graphs/maps of Crime Rates in various categories\nReveal the spatial distribution of crimes in the study area\n\nGlobal and Local Spatial Autocorrelation\n\nGlobal: Make use of measures such as Moran I’s, Geary C’s to determine if the spatial patterns of the crime events are clustered or are randomly distributed\nLocal: Make use of measures such as Local Moran I’s and Getis-Ord Gi* statistic to identify cold and/or hotspot areas for crime events in our study area.\n\nMapping our results and Interpretation\nConclusion\n\n\n\n\nApplication System Architecture\n\n\n\n\nShiny Storyboard"
