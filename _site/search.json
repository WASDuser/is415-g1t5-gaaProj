However, would that still be wise for Singapre’s immediate neighbour, Malaysia?\nOur project aims to inform users (or tourists) about the patterns and trends of crime in Malaysia, also helping them manage travel risk for their destinations. More specifically, we will be incorporating Spatial-Temporal analysis of crime activity, Global and Local autocorrelation and an array of visualisation techniques.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Objectives\n\nIdentify and detect the crime rates hotspots, clusters, and outliers\nAccess global and local spatial autocorrelation in Crime Rates in Malaysia\n\n\n\n\nDatasets\n\nCrime Rates working data\nShapefile (Administrative level 0-2)\n\n\n\n\nApproach and Methodology\n\nData Preparation\n\nSourcing data and Importing data\nData Wrangling\n\nProcessing imported data to keep only needed information\nRestricting study area by focusing on a particular type of crime\nHandling missing/duplicated data\nCleaning up of data\nExamine data to identify patterns\nJoining of boundary and working data\nPerform a write and read to rds for easier access to variable\n\n\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n\nVisualising graphs/maps of Crime Rates in various categories\nExplore interactive or animative plots to showcase time-based flow of traffic activities\n\nGlobal and Local Spatial Autocorrelation\nPlotting our results and Interpretation\nConclusion\n\n\n\n\nBibliography\n\nPhim, R., Nick Beresford, Nimnuon Ivek, Lang Sok, Bora Phat, Richard Marshall, Iván Gonzalez de Alba, Chandarany Ouch, Sun Chanthol, Men Manvy, Prum Vantha, Boran Sattya, Tho Dalin, Uy Map, & Pich Chanbandith.
