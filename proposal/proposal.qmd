# Project Motivation

Singaporean's often take their home's relatively low crime rate for granted, often bringing that mindset along when they visit faraway countries. However, would that still be wise for Singapre's immediate neighbour, Malaysia?

Our project aims to inform users (or tourists) about the patterns and trends of crime in Malaysia, also helping them manage travel risk for their destinations. More specifically, we will be incorporating Spatial-Temporal analysis of crime activity, Global and Local autocorrelation and an array of visualisation techniques.

# Project Objectives

-   Identify and detect the crime rates hotspots, clusters, and outliers

-   Access global and local spatial autocorrelation in Crime Rates in Malaysia

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Datasets

-   [Crime Rates working data](https://data.gov.my/data-catalogue/crime_district)
-   [Shapefile (Administrative level 0-2)](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/cod-ab-mys?)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Approach and Methodology

-   **Data Preparation**

    1.  Sourcing data and Importing data
    2.  Data Wrangling
        -   Processing imported data to keep only needed information

        -   Restricting study area by focusing on a particular type of crime

        -   Handling missing/duplicated data

        -   Cleaning up of data

        -   Examine data to identify patterns

        -   Joining of boundary and working data

        -   Perform a write and read to rds for easier access to variable

-   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

    1.  Visualising graphs/maps of Crime Rates in various categories
    2.  Explore interactive or animative plots to showcase time-based flow of traffic activities

-   **Global and Local Spatial Autocorrelation**

-   **Plotting our results and Interpretation**

-   **Conclusion**
