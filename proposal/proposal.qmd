# Project Motivation

Singaporeans take their home's low crime rate for granted, often bringing that mindset along when they visit other countries. One of the most popular getaway destinations for us is our neighbour, Malaysia, given the multiple factors of convenience like proximity and the relatively lower cost. However, it will not be wise to assume the same level of safety as we have in Singapore.

Our project aims to raise awareness about the crimes and safety issues in Malaysia, so that tourists can manage travel risk for their destinations. Spatial Point Pattern Analysis can aid in providing useful insights on the distribution of crime in Malaysia. Exploratory Data Analysis can be utilised to identify hotspots or cold spot areas for crimes of different types, providing travellers with more concrete information when deciding which states to travel to.

# Project Objectives

-   Visualise the Crime events on a map of the study area

-   Figure out if there are any patterns relating the crime type and the spatial units in the study area

-   Identify the crime rates hotspots and clusters

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Datasets

-   [Crime Rates working data](https://data.gov.my/data-catalogue/crime_district): Aspatial Data that covers specifics of the crimes committed in the various states.
-   [Shapefile (Administrative level 0-2)](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/cod-ab-mys?): Shapefile that contains the admin boundaries of Malaysia

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Approach and Methodology

-   **Data Preparation**

    1.  Sourcing data and Importing data
    2.  Data Wrangling
        -   Processing imported data to keep only needed information

        -   Restricting study area

        -   Handling missing/duplicated data

        -   Cleaning up of data

        -   Examine data to identify patterns

        -   Joining of boundary and working data

        -   Perform a write and read to rds for easier access to variable

-   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

    1.  Visualising graphs/maps of Crime Rates in various categories
    2.  Reveal the spatial distribution of crimes in the study area

-   **Global and Local Spatial Autocorrelation**

    1.  Global: Make use of measures such as Moran I's, Geary C's to determine if the spatial patterns of the crime events are clustered or are randomly distributed
    2.  Local: Make use of measures such as Local Moran I's and Getis-Ord Gi\* statistic to identify cold and/or hotspot areas for crime events in our study area.

-   **Mapping our results and Interpretation**

-   **Conclusion**
