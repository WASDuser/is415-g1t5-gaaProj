# Project Motivation

Singaporeans take their home's low crime rate for granted, often bringing that mindset along when they visit other countries. One of the most popular getaway destinations for us is our neighbour, Malaysia, given the multiple factors of convenience like proximity and the relatively lower cost. However, it will not be wise to assume the same level of safety as we have in Singapore.

Our project aims to raise awareness about the crimes and safety issues in Malaysia, so that tourists can manage travel risk for their destinations. Spatial Point Pattern Analysis can aid in providing useful insights on the distribution of crime in Malaysia. Exploratory Data Analysis can be utilised to identify hotspots or cold spot areas for crimes of different types, providing travellers with more concrete information when deciding which states to travel to.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Project Objectives

-   Visualise the crime rates of different crime types by districts, on a map of Peninsular and East Malaysian Regions

-   Figure out if there are any patterns relating the crime type and the spatial units in the study area

-   Identify the crime rate hotspots and clusters

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Datasets

-   [Crime Rates working data](https://data.gov.my/data-catalogue/crime_district): Aspatial Data that covers specifics of the crimes committed in the various states.
-   [Shapefile (Administrative level 0-2)](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/cod-ab-mys?): Shapefile that contains the district boundaries of Malaysia

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Literature Review

-   [Criminological Insights: A Comprehensive Spatial Analysis of Crime Hot Spots of Property Offenses in Malaysia's Urban Centers](https://journals2.ums.ac.id/fg/article/view/4306/1203)

    -   **Objective:**

        -   To examine patterns in property crimes in Selangor, Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya from 2015-2020

        -   To understand the evolution and dynamics of property crimes

        -   To better understand the effects of the National Transformation Programme

    -   **Geospatial and Aspatial Data:**

        -   Study areas (Geospatial data) were methodically chosen for their wealth, geopolitical landscape and vibrant city life and attractions. More specifically, the study makes use of the Police Station boundaries in these states.

        -   Property Crime incidents and their spatial characteristics served as the aspatial data for the study.

    -   **Methods Deployed:**

        -   Global Measure of Spatial Autocorrelation: Global Moran I's Statistic

        -   Local Measure of Spatial Autocorrelation & Hot spot analysis: Getis-Ord Gi\* Statistic

    -   **Learnings and Takeaways:**

        -   Instead of deploying a wide range of different measures, the study deployed these two methods using different categories (By year, By Location) to gain a more comprehensive understanding of crimes of the this nature

        -   Using Police/Jurisdical boundaries to examine crime events is very appropriate and will be useful when chaneling efforts to lower crime rates

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Approach and Methodology

-   **Data Preparation**

    1.  Sourcing data and Importing data
    2.  Data Wrangling
        -   Processing imported data to keep only needed information

        -   Handling missing/duplicated data

        -   Cleaning and standardising data

        -   Joining of boundary and working data

        -   Perform a write and read to rds for easier access to variable

-   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

    1.  Plotting a barchart to observe for the number of crimes by districts to gain insights into more crime-prone regions on Malaysia.
    2.  Plotting choropleth maps to reflect the spatial distribution of crimes in Malaysia

-   **Global and Local Spatial Autocorrelation**

    1.  Global: Make use of measures such as Moran I's to determine if the spatial patterns of the crime events are clustered, randomly distributed, or show a pattern of dispersion.
    2.  Local: Make use of measures such as Local Moran I's and Getis-Ord Gi\* statistic to identify cold and/or hotspot areas for crime events in our study area.

-   **Clustering Analysis**

    1.  Deploy various methods of geographical segmentation, like Hierarchical Clustering, SKATER Approach and ClustGeo to observe for any natural clustering of spatial units based on the crime rates.

-   **Mapping our results and Interpretation**

-   **Conclusion**
