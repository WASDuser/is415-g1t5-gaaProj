    <li><b>Shape_Leng</b>: A numeric value representing the perimeter length of the district's geographical shape (in an appropriate spatial unit).</li>
    <li><b>Shape_Area</b>: A numeric value representing the area of the district's geographical shape.</li>
    <li><b>type</b>: The category of the crime (e.g., 'causing_injury,' 'murder,' 'rape').</li>
    <li><b>date.y</b>: The date when the crime data was recorded (e.g., '2016-01-01').</li>
    <li><b>year</b>: The year corresponding to the crime record (e.g., 2016).</li>
    <li><b>crimes</b>: The total number of reported crimes for the given type, district, and year.</li>
    <li><b>crime_rate</b>: The crime rate calculated based on the population of the district. This provides a standardized measure for comparison.</li>

    <li><b>region</b>: Indicates whether the data belongs to Peninsular Malaysia or East Malaysia (e.g., 'Peninsular').</li>
    <li><b>geometry</b>: Spatial geometry object representing the geographical boundaries of the district. This is used for mapping and spatial analysis.</li>
  </ul>
  <br><b>Dataset Features:</b><br>
  <ul>
    <li>The data spans multiple years (2016â€“2023), allowing for temporal trends and comparisons.</li>
    <li>Crimes are categorized into types such as <i>causing injury, murder, and rape</i>, providing a diverse view of crime types.</li>
    <li>Includes <b>spatial attributes</b> (e.g., Shape_Leng, Shape_Area, and geometry) for advanced geospatial analysis.</li>
    <li><b>Standardized crime rates</b> enable comparisons across districts and years, accounting for population differences.</li>
    <li>Focused on <b>Batu Pahat</b>, providing localized insights into crime trends in a specific district of Johor.</li>
  </ul>

    <b>Bar Chart</b>
    <br>A bar chart is a graphical representation of categorical data. Each category is represented by a bar whose length corresponds to its frequency or count. This is useful for comparing discrete groups or categories in your dataset.<br>
    <b>Boxplot</b>
    <br>A boxplot is a standardized way of displaying the distribution of data based on a five-number summary: minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum. It highlights outliers and variability within a dataset.<br>
    <b>Histogram</b>
    <br>A histogram is a graphical representation of the distribution of numerical data. It groups data into bins or intervals, allowing for the visualization of frequency distributions and data spread.
